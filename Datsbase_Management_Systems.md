## 📌 What is Data?

| Term            | Meaning                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Data**        | Raw facts (numbers, text, symbols) |
| **Information** | Processed data with meaning        |

📍 Example:

```
Data:   120, 130, 140
Info:   Stock prices increased over 3 days
```

## 📌 What is a Database?

A **database** is a **structured collection of related data** stored electronically so it can be:

* accessed efficiently
* updated safely
* managed at scale

📦 Examples:

* Bank accounts
* User profiles
* Stock market trades
* Orders in e-commerce

---

## 📌 What is DBMS?

A **DBMS (Database Management System)** is software that:

* creates databases
* stores data
* retrieves data
* updates data
* protects data

📌 It acts as a **middle layer** between:

```
User / Application  ⇄  DBMS  ⇄  Database
```

## 🧩 Why Not Just Use Files?

### ❌ File System Problems

| Problem            | Explanation                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Data Redundancy    | Same data stored multiple times |
| Data Inconsistency | Different copies ≠ same value   |
| No Security        | Anyone can access files         |
| No Concurrency     | Multiple users cause conflicts  |
| Hard Queries       | No easy search / filtering      |
| No Recovery        | Crash = data loss               |

---

## ✅ How DBMS Solves This

| Feature          | DBMS Benefit      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Centralized data | No duplication    |
| Constraints      | Data correctness  |
| Security         | Role-based access |
| Transactions     | Safe operations   |
| SQL              | Powerful querying |
| Recovery         | Crash protection  |

## 🧱 Core Components of DBMS

| Component           | Role                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Query Processor     | Converts SQL → execution plan |
| Storage Manager     | Manages disk & memory         |
| Transaction Manager | Ensures ACID                  |
| Buffer Manager      | Speeds up data access         |
| Authorization       | Security & permissions        |

---

## 📊 Data Models (How Data Is Structured)

| Model           | Description        |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Hierarchical    | Tree-like          |
| Network         | Graph-like         |
| Relational      | Tables (most used) |
| Object-Oriented | Objects            |

📌 **Relational Model dominates** because:

* simple
* flexible
* mathematically sound
* easy querying (SQL)

---

## 🧩 ER Model (Conceptual Design)

| Term         | Meaning           |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Entity       | Real-world object |
| Attribute    | Property          |
| Relationship | Connection        |

📌 Example:

```
Customer — places — Order
```

---

## 🧮 Relational Model

| Concept     | Meaning                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Table       | Relation                   |
| Row         | Tuple                      |
| Column      | Attribute                  |
| Primary Key | Unique identifier          |
| Foreign Key | Reference to another table |

---

## 🧼 Normalization (Why It Exists)

### Goal:

* Remove redundancy
* Avoid anomalies

| Normal Form | Purpose                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 1NF         | Atomic values            |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency    |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency |
| BCNF        | Strongest practical form |

📌 Trade-off:

```
More normalization → less redundancy → more joins
```

---

## 🧠 Transactions

A **transaction** is a sequence of operations treated as **one unit**.

```
BEGIN → READ → WRITE → COMMIT / ROLLBACK
```

---

## 🔐 ACID Properties

| Property    | Meaning         |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Atomicity   | All or nothing  |
| Consistency | Valid state     |
| Isolation   | No interference |
| Durability  | Data persists   |

📍 Banking analogy:
Money deducted **only if** credited.  

---

## ⚔️ Concurrency Control

Problems DBMS prevents:

* Dirty Read
* Lost Update
* Inconsistent Read

Handled using:

* Locks
* Isolation levels
* Schedulers

---

## 🧠 SQL Overview

| Category | Commands         |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| DDL      | CREATE, DROP     |
| DML      | INSERT, UPDATE   |
| DCL      | GRANT, REVOKE    |
| TCL      | COMMIT, ROLLBACK |

---

## 📈 DBMS in Real Systems

| Domain       | Usage              |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Banking      | Transactions       |
| E-commerce   | Orders & inventory |
| Stock Market | Trades, analytics  |
| Social Media | User data          |
